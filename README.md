# Sorting and Searching algorithms comparison
This project is a benchmarking and testing suite for various sorting and searching algorithms. 
It includes six sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, 
and Heap Sort. These algorithms are tested on a dataset of 5000 random numbers in the range [1, 10000], 
and the time taken to sort the dataset is measured.

The project also includes five searching algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search, Interpolation Search, 
Binary Interpolation Search (BIS), and Improved Binary Interpolation Search (Improved BIS). These algorithms 
are tested on two datasets of 10000 numbers each, one normal distributed and the other uniformly distributed 
in the range [1, 100000]. The time taken to search for a specific value in each dataset is measured.

The project aims to provide a comprehensive comparison of the efficiency and performance of these algorithms, 
allowing users to choose the best algorithm for their specific needs. The results of each test are printed to 
the console, and users have the option to print the sorted arrays or not. It is written in the C programming
language.
